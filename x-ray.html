          <p style="color: paleturquoise;">
        William Conrad Roentgen accidently discovered x-rays while he was working on cathode rays inside his laboratory in 1895. He discorvered that this new type of rays was being emmited and could pass through most hard objects. This was an extremely significant discovery, which led to many people passionate and interested during this time period. After that, just 2 years later during the Balkan War, x-rays were used to find broken bones and bullets inside of the wounded. <p/>
